case: I want to work on my project on a different computer
--> download and unzip
--> connect local to remote:
git remote add origin <remote_repo_url>
git push --all origin

case: I'm back at my actual computer and I want to update my local with remote (remote has changes that I've made 
on a different computer)
git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories

exit bizzare editor in the console --> don't do anything with it
