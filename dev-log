in dev con:

@App.js
-> loads user
-> jumps to landing page

@Landing.js
-> check if user is authenticated 
--> if yes - redirect to /dashboard.js
--> if no - render landing page

@dashboard.js
-> load user's profile
-> render user's profile


@routes/api/carts.js
line 25 --> from here code has to be worked on 
--> question is: do I update user_id in cart object if user registers? I think put request. But how is the 
route end point beeing hit

answer:

@App.js
-> loads user
-> jumps to landing page

@Landing.js
-> check if user is authenticated 
--> if yes 
- load users cart

--> if no 
- create new cart
- render login link (directs to Login.js)
- render register link (directs to Register.js)

@Login.js
-> on login --> load user's cart

@Register.js
-> on registration --> update existing cart with user_id


@cart.js --> figure out how to create new cart with or without loged in user 
--> problem: req.user.id works only if function has auth but auth throws an error if no token is send
(meaning no user is logged in)
